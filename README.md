## Practical Projects

For maximum learning benefit, work on these projects that combine multiple skill areas:

1. **Secure Infrastructure Setup**
   - Create a multi-tier application with proper security groups
   - Set up secure SSH access with bastion hosts
   - Implement proper IAM roles and policies

2. **High-Availability Database Deployment**
   - Deploy a replicated database with failover
   - Set up proper backup and recovery
   - Implement monitoring and alerting

3. **Cross-Region VPN Network**
   - Connect multiple VPCs across regions
   - Implement proper routing and security
   - Set up monitoring and failover

4. **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Create IaC templates for all components
   - Implement CI/CD for infrastructure
   - Include testing and validation

## AWS-Specific Skills

As an Amazon Dedicated Cloud Engineer, focus especially on:

1. **VPC Architecture**
   - Subnetting and CIDR allocation
   - Security Groups vs NACLs
   - Transit Gateway and VPC Peering

2. **AWS Connectivity Options**
   - Site-to-Site VPN
   - Direct Connect
   - Client VPN
   - AWS PrivateLink

3. **AWS Specific Services**
   - RDS and Aurora configuration
   - DynamoDB design patterns
   - ElastiCache optimization
   - CloudWatch monitoring
